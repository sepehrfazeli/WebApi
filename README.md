sepehrfazeli: Please find the assignment details for WebApi below.

Create a WebApi using .NET Core for Student data. (Name it Student Management System) User should be able to: a. Add a detail for a student b. Delete a detail for a student based on Id c. Get student details based on Id d. Update data for a student based on Id e. Get all students' data Student Data can contain details like: name, class, score, etc. (Add some details as per your convenience) The data should be stored in a SQL database i. Install MySQL from the official website (you can choose the database type of your wish) ii. When the user adds student data, the data should be added to the database, i.e., any action insert, update, delete done on student details should reflect in the database iii. Use Entity Framework for connecting your application with the database. Include data validations for all the data sent by the user Exception Handling should be done Try to cover your code with unit tests using XUnit (Nice to have) Please look for a solution which is using DI and abstraction in the solution. Tips Aim is to have a running project but also to understand how this works inside. You will find step-by-step implementation for the exact same project on Google. More than a working project, understand how the project is implemented, e.g., DI, API calls, route mapping, database connection, abstraction in the project. Try to research on any new things you encounter in between. Try to write clean code. If you install any software for the database or Postman or SDKs, please make sure you do it from the official website.

GitHub Copilot: Here's a step-by-step plan to create a .NET Core Web API for a Student Management System:

1. Create a new .NET Core Web API project named "Student Management System".
2. Define a `Student` model with properties like `Id`, `Name`, `Class`, `Score`, etc.
3. Set up a MySQL database to store the student data.
4. Install Entity Framework Core and the provider for MySQL.
5. Create a `DbContext` for managing database operations.
6. Define a `StudentsController` with actions for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
7. Implement Dependency Injection (DI) for the `DbContext` in the controller.
8. Add data validation attributes to the `Student` model.
9. Implement exception handling in the controller actions.
10. Write unit tests for the controller actions using XUnit.
11. Ensure clean code practices are followed throughout.

Here's a simplified version of what the code might look like:

```csharp
// Student.cs
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Class { get; set; }
    public double Score { get; set; }
}

// ApplicationDbContext.cs
public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options) { }
    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
}

// StudentsController.cs
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class StudentsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;
    public StudentsController(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    // GET: api/Students
    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<Student>>> GetStudents()
    {
        return await _context.Students.ToListAsync();
    }

    // GET: api/Students/5
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<Student>> GetStudent(int id)
    {
        var student = await _context.Students.FindAsync(id);
        if (student == null)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }
        return student;
    }

    // PUT: api/Students/5
    [HttpPut("{id}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> PutStudent(int id, Student student)
    {
        if (id != student.Id)
        {
            return BadRequest();
        }
        _context.Entry(student).State = EntityState.Modified;
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return NoContent();
    }

    // POST: api/Students
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<ActionResult<Student>> PostStudent(Student student)
    {
        _context.Students.Add(student);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return CreatedAtAction("GetStudent", new { id = student.Id }, student);
    }

    // DELETE: api/Students/5
    [HttpDelete("{id}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteStudent(int id)
    {
        var student = await _context.Students.FindAsync(id);
        if (student == null)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }
        _context.Students.Remove(student);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return NoContent();
    }
}
```

Remember to add the necessary `using` statements at the top of your files. Also, don't forget to configure your database connection string in `appsettings.json` and register your `DbContext` in the `Startup.cs` file.

sepehrfazeli: let do the first step , but i don't want the dotnet new command create a new folder named Student Management System. i just want all file to this directory

GitHub Copilot: To create a new .NET Core Web API project in the current directory without creating a new folder, you can use the `dotnet new` command with the `-n` (name) option and the `--output` option set to `.` (current directory). Here's how you can do it:

```bash
dotnet new webapi -n StudentManagementSystem --output .
```

This command will create a new .NET Core Web API project named "StudentManagementSystem" in the current directory. Please note that the project name cannot contain spaces.

sepehrfazeli: can i run this ?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can run the command in your terminal. Make sure you are in the directory where you want the project files to be created. After running the command, your new .NET Core Web API project will be set up in the current directory.

Once the project is created, you can run it using the `dotnet run` command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This will start the application and it will begin listening for HTTP requests. By default, it will be hosted on `http://localhost:5000` and `https://localhost:5001`.

sepehrfazeli: it's not available on http://localhost:5000 and https://localhost:5001.

GitHub Copilot: The `launchSettings.json` file in your project configures the settings for the web server when you run your application. From the excerpt you've provided, it appears that your application is configured to run on `http://localhost:5012` for HTTP and `https://localhost:7184` for HTTPS.

You can access your application at these URLs when you run your application with `dotnet run`. If you want to change these settings, you can modify the `applicationUrl` values in the `launchSettings.json` file.

If you want your application to run on `http://localhost:5000` and `https://localhost:5001`, you can change your `launchSettings.json` to look like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
  "iisSettings": {
    "windowsAuthentication": false,
    "anonymousAuthentication": true,
    "iisExpress": {
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
      "sslPort": 44324
    }
  },
  "profiles": {
    "http": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "launchUrl": "swagger",
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    },
    "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "launchUrl": "swagger",
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    },
    "IIS Express": {
      "commandName": "IISExpress",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "launchUrl": "swagger",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After making these changes, your application should be available at `http://localhost:5000` and `https://localhost:5001` when you run it with `dotnet run`.

sepehrfazeli: no i don't want to change it. how this is usable ? what does it means that my application is configured to run on http://localhost:5012 for HTTP and https://localhost:7184 for HTTPS. what it's use for ?

GitHub Copilot: The URLs `http://localhost:5012` and `https://localhost:7184` are the addresses where your application will be hosted when you run it locally on your machine. 

`localhost` is the standard hostname for your local machine, it always refers to the current device used to view the webpage. 

The numbers `5012` and `7184` are the ports on which your application is running. A port is a specific place for being able to conduct a particular transaction, in this case, serving your web application.

The `http` and `https` are the protocols used by the web server. `http` stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and the `s` in `https` stands for secure, meaning it's a secure version of `http` - it encrypts all communication between your browser and the website.

When you run your application with `dotnet run`, you can open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5012` or `https://localhost:7184` to interact with your application. 

For example, if your application has a route to get all students at `api/students`, you would use `http://localhost:5012/api/students` or `https://localhost:7184/api/students` to access it.

sepehrfazeli: okey, so lets get to the next step

GitHub Copilot: The next step is to define a `Student` model with properties like `Id`, `Name`, `Class`, `Score`, etc. 

Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
// Student.cs
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Class { get; set; }
    public double Score { get; set; }
}
```

This code defines a `Student` class with four properties: `Id`, `Name`, `Class`, and `Score`. The `Id` property is an integer that will serve as the unique identifier for each student. The `Name` and `Class` properties are strings that will hold the student's name and class, respectively. The `Score` property is a double that will hold the student's score.

You should create this file in the Models directory of your project. If the Models directory does not exist, you will need to create it.

sepehrfazeli: i did, lets go to next step

GitHub Copilot: The next step is to set up a MySQL database to store the student data. Here's a general outline of the steps you'll need to follow:

1. Install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench from the official MySQL website if you haven't already.
2. Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection.
3. Once connected, create a new schema for your application. You could name it "StudentManagementSystem".
4. In the new schema, create a table named "Students" with columns that correspond to the properties in your `Student` model. For example, you might have columns for `Id`, `Name`, `Class`, and `Score`.

Please note that these steps might vary slightly depending on your specific setup and requirements. Also, remember to keep track of your connection details (server, port, username, password, and schema), as you'll need them to configure the database connection in your .NET Core application.

Once you've set up your MySQL database, the next step will be to install Entity Framework Core and the provider for MySQL in your .NET Core application. You can do this using the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
```

The `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package is the main Entity Framework Core package, while `Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql` is a popular provider that allows Entity Framework Core to work with MySQL.

sepehrfazeli: can i use docker hub instead of installing  MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench from the official MySQL website?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can definitely use Docker to run a MySQL server. It's a great way to avoid having to install MySQL directly on your machine. Here's how you can do it:

1. If you haven't already, install Docker from the official Docker website.

2. Run the following command in your terminal to pull the latest MySQL Docker image:

```bash
docker pull mysql
```

3. Once the image is pulled, you can run a new container with this command:

```bash
docker run --name mysql-student-management -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mysql
```

This command creates a new Docker container named `mysql-student-management`, maps port 3306 inside the Docker container to port 3306 on your local machine, sets the root password to `my-secret-pw`, and runs the container in the background.

4. You can then connect to your MySQL server using any MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or even the MySQL CLI) with the following connection details:

   - Hostname: `localhost`
   - Port: `3306`
   - User: `root`
   - Password: `my-secret-pw`

5. Once connected, you can create your `StudentManagementSystem` schema and `Students` table as described in the previous step.

Remember to replace `my-secret-pw` with a secure password of your choice. Also, keep in mind that any data stored in the Docker container will be lost if the container is removed. If you want to persist your data, you'll need to use Docker volumes.

sepehrfazeli: i have this error in DBeaver "Public Key Retrieval is not allowed
Public Key Retrieval is not allowed
"

GitHub Copilot: This error occurs because, by default, the MySQL Connector/J driver doesn't allow the loading of public keys from the MySQL server. You can fix this issue by adding `allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true` to your connection string.

However, please note that enabling this option makes your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. It's recommended to use this option only during development and not in production.

Here's how you can add it to your connection string:

```bash
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
```

Replace `your_database` with the name of your database. This connection string disables SSL and allows the loading of public keys from the MySQL server. 

If you're using DBeaver, you can add this parameter in the connection settings:

1. Open the connection settings.
2. Go to the "Driver Properties" tab.
3. Add a new property with the name `allowPublicKeyRetrieval` and the value `true`.

Remember to save your changes and reconnect to the database.

sepehrfazeli: it works now let go to the next step

GitHub Copilot: Great! Now that your MySQL server is up and running, the next step is to configure your .NET Core application to connect to this database. 

You'll need to do the following:

1. Install the necessary Entity Framework Core packages.
2. Define a `DbContext` that represents a session with your database.
3. Configure your application to use this `DbContext` with the correct connection string.

First, install the necessary packages with these commands:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
```

Next, define a `DbContext`. Here's an example:

```csharp
// StudentManagementContext.cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using YourNamespace.Models;

public class StudentManagementContext : DbContext
{
    public StudentManagementContext(DbContextOptions<StudentManagementContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
```

Replace `YourNamespace` with the actual namespace of your `Student` model. This `DbContext` has a `DbSet<Student>` property that represents the Students table in your database.

Finally, configure your application to use this `DbContext` in the `Startup.cs` file:

```csharp
// Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<StudentManagementContext>(options =>
        options.UseMySql(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"), 
        new MySqlServerVersion(new Version(8, 0, 21))));

    // Other service configurations...
}
```

And add the connection string in your `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "server=localhost;port=3306;database=StudentManagementSystem;user=root;password=my-secret-pw"
  },

  // Other settings...
}
```

Replace `my-secret-pw` with your actual MySQL root password. This connection string tells Entity Framework Core how to connect to your MySQL server.

After these steps, your application should be able to connect to your MySQL database.

sepehrfazeli: what about thease steps :

Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection.
Once connected, create a new schema for your application. You could name it "StudentManagementSystem".
In the new schema, create a table named "Students" with columns that correspond to the properties in your Student model. For example, you might have columns for Id, Name, Class, and Score.

GitHub Copilot: If you're using Entity Framework Core with Code First approach, you don't need to manually create the `Students` table in your MySQL database. Entity Framework Core can automatically create the database schema for you based on your `DbContext` and entity classes.

To create the database schema, you can use Entity Framework Core migrations. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, install the Entity Framework Core tools by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

2. Next, add an initial migration with this command:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

This command creates a new migration that includes the creation of the `Students` table based on your `Student` entity class.

3. Finally, apply the migration to the database with this command:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

This command creates the `Students` table in your MySQL database.

After running these commands, you should see the `Students` table in your MySQL database. The table should have columns that correspond to the properties in your `Student` entity class.

sepehrfazeli: So  i didn't underestan which step should o go first ?
this:
"
Install the necessary Entity Framework Core packages.
Define a DbContext that represents a session with your database.
Configure your application to use this DbContext with the correct connection string.
"
or this:
"
2. Open MySQL Workbench (dbeaver) and create a new connection.
3. Once connected, create a new schema for your application. You could name it "StudentManagementSystem".
4. In the new schema, create a table named "Students" with columns that correspond to the properties in your `Student` model. For example, you might have columns for `Id`, `Name`, `Class`, and `Score`.
"

GitHub Copilot: The order of the steps depends on whether you're using the Code First or the Database First approach with Entity Framework Core.

If you're using the Code First approach, you should first install the necessary Entity Framework Core packages, define a `DbContext`, and configure your application to use this `DbContext`. Then, you can use Entity Framework Core migrations to automatically create the database schema based on your `DbContext` and entity classes.

If you're using the Database First approach, you should first create the database schema manually using a MySQL client like MySQL Workbench or DBeaver. Then, you can install the necessary Entity Framework Core packages, define a `DbContext` that matches your existing database schema, and configure your application to use this `DbContext`.

In both cases, you'll need to have a running MySQL server and a connection to this server from your .NET Core application. The connection details (server, port, username, password, and schema) should be specified in the connection string in your `appsettings.json` file.

sepehrfazeli: lets go with whatever you suggest 

GitHub Copilot: I suggest going with the Code First approach. It's a bit more straightforward and allows you to manage your database schema directly from your .NET Core application.

Here are the steps:

1. Install the necessary Entity Framework Core packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
```

2. Define a `DbContext` that represents a session with your database:

```csharp
// StudentManagementContext.cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using YourNamespace.Models;

public class StudentManagementContext : DbContext
{
    public StudentManagementContext(DbContextOptions<StudentManagementContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
```

Replace `YourNamespace` with the actual namespace of your `Student` model.

3. Configure your application to use this `DbContext` in the `Startup.cs` file:

```csharp
// Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<StudentManagementContext>(options =>
        options.UseMySql(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"), 
        new MySqlServerVersion(new Version(8, 0, 21))));

    // Other service configurations...
}
```

4. Add the connection string in your `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "server=localhost;port=3306;database=StudentManagementSystem;user=root;password=my-secret-pw"
  },

  // Other settings...
}
```

Replace `my-secret-pw` with your actual MySQL root password.

5. Install the Entity Framework Core tools:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

6. Add an initial migration:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

7. Apply the migration to the database:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

After these steps, your application should be able to connect to your MySQL database, and the `Students` table should be created in your database.

sepehrfazeli: dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
tnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySqlCommand 'dotnet' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo snap install dotnet-sdk       # version 8.0.100, or
sudo apt  install dotnet-host      # version 6.0.124-0ubuntu1~22.04.1
sudo apt  install dotnet-host-7.0  # version 7.0.113-0ubuntu1~22.04.1
See 'snap info dotnet-sdk' for additional versions.


GitHub Copilot: It seems like the .NET Core SDK is not installed or not found in your system. You can install it using the suggested command:

```bash
sudo snap install dotnet-sdk
```

After installing the .NET Core SDK, you will need to add it to your PATH. If you installed the SDK using snap, you can do this by running the following command:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/snap/dotnet-sdk/current
```

Then, you should be able to run `dotnet` commands. Try running `dotnet --version` to check if the installation was successful. If it was, you should see the version of your .NET Core SDK.

After that, you can proceed with installing the Entity Framework Core packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
```

sepehrfazeli:  sudo snap install dotnet-sdk
[sudo] password for sepehr: 
error: This revision of snap "dotnet-sdk" was published using classic confinement and thus may
       perform arbitrary system changes outside of the security sandbox that snaps are usually

       If you understand and want to proceed repeat the command including --classic.
sepehr@LP52-SFI19-DEU:/mnt/e/Git/WebApi$ sudo snap install dotnet-sdk

GitHub Copilot: The error message is indicating that the `dotnet-sdk` snap package requires classic confinement, which means it has permissions to access and modify system resources outside of its confinement. This is typical for development tools like the .NET SDK.

To install the `dotnet-sdk` snap package with classic confinement, you can use the `--classic` option as suggested by the error message. Here's the command:

```bash
sudo snap install dotnet-sdk --classic
```

After running this command, the .NET SDK should be installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running `dotnet --version`. If the installation was successful, you should see the version of your .NET SDK.

sepehrfazeli: where should i creat my DbContext ?

GitHub Copilot: You should create your `DbContext` in a separate file in your project. Typically, this file is placed in the `Data` or `Models` directory of your project.

Here's an example of how you can create a `DbContext`:

```csharp
// Data/StudentManagementContext.cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using YourNamespace.Models;

namespace YourNamespace.Data
{
    public class StudentManagementContext : DbContext
    {
        public StudentManagementContext(DbContextOptions<StudentManagementContext> options)
            : base(options)
        {
        }

        public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Replace `YourNamespace` with the actual namespace of your project. This `DbContext` has a `DbSet<Student>` property that represents the `Students` table in your database.

After creating this `DbContext`, you can use it to interact with your database. For example, you can use it to query the `Students` table or to add new students to the table.

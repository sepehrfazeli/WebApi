# WebApi Assignment

## Task Description

Please find the assignment details for WebApi below.

1. **Create a WebApi using .NET Core for Student data. (Name it Student Management System)**
2. **User should be able to:**
   a. Add a detail for a student
   b. Delete a detail for a student based on Id
   c. Get student details based on Id
   d. Update data for a student based on Id
   e. Get all students' data
3. **Student Data can contain details like: name, class, score, etc. (Add some details as per your convenience)**
4. **The data should be stored in a SQL database**
   i. Install MySQL from the official website (you can choose the database type of your wish)
   ii. When the user adds student data, the data should be added to the database, i.e., any action insert, update, delete done on student details should reflect in the database
   iii. Use Entity Framework for connecting your application with the database.
5. **Include data validations for all the data sent by the user**
6. **Exception Handling should be done**
7. **Try to cover your code with unit tests using XUnit (Nice to have)**
8. **Please look for a solution which is using DI and abstraction in the solution.**

## Tips

- Aim is to have a running project but also to understand how this works inside. You will find step-by-step implementation for the exact same project on Google.
- More than a working project, understand how the project is implemented, e.g., DI, API calls, route mapping, database connection, abstraction in the project.
- Try to research on any new things you encounter in between.
- Try to write clean code.
- If you install any software for the database or Postman or SDKs, please make sure you do it from the official website.

**If you want to take one step further, you can create an MVC project too for the same, which will have frontend and backend both.**
